	abstract = {Marine fish populations have high variation in cohort strength, and the production of juveniles (recruitment) may have persistent positive or negative residuals (autocorrelation) after accounting for spawning biomass. Autocorrelated recruitment will occur whenever average recruitment levels change between oceanographic regimes or due to predator release, but may also indicate persistent environmental and biological effects on shorter time-scales. Here, we use estimates of recruitment variability and autocorrelation to simulate the stationary distribution of spawning biomass for 100 real-world stocks when unfished, fished at FMSY, or fished following a harvest control rule where fishing mortality decreases as a function of spawning biomass. Results show that unfished stocks have spawning biomass (SB) below its deterministic equilibrium value (SB0) 58\% of the time, and below 0.5SB0 5\% of the time on average across all stocks. Similarly, stocks fished at the level producing deterministic maximum sustainable yield (FMSY) are below its deterministic prediction of spawning biomass (SBMSY) 60\% of the time and below 0.5SBMSY 8\% of the time. These probabilities are greater for stocks with high recruitment variability, positive autocorrelation, and high natural mortality—traits that are particularly associated with clupeids and scombrids. An elevated probability of stochastic depletion, i.e. biomass below the deterministic equilibrium expectation, implies that management actions required when biomass drops below a threshold may be triggered more frequently than expected. Therefore, we conclude by suggesting that fisheries scientists routinely calculate these probabilities during stock assessments as a decision support tool for fisheries managers.},

	abstract = {Methods for determining appropriate management actions for data-poor stocks, including annual catch limits (ACLs), have seen an explosion of research interest in the past decade. We perform an inventory of methods for determining ACLs for stocks in the United States, and find that ACLs are assigned to 371 stocks and/or stock complexes with 193 (52\%) determined using methods involving catch data only. The proportion of ACLs involving these methods varies widely among fisheries management regions, with all the 67 ACLs in the Caribbean determined using recent catch when compared with 1 of 33 ACLs in the New England region (US Northeast). Given this prevalence of data-poor ACLs, we recommend additional research regarding the potential effectiveness of simple management procedures for data-poor stocks that are currently managed using ACLs. In particular, simple management procedures may allow a broader range of data types and management instruments that better suit the particulars of individual regions and stocks.},

	abstract = {The majority of global fish stocks lack adequate data to evaluate stock status using conventional stock assessment methods. This poses a challenge for the sustainable management of these stocks. Recent requirements to set scientifically based catch limits in several countries, and growing consumer demand for sustainably managed fish have spurred an emerging field of methods for estimating overfishing thresholds and setting catch limits for stocks with limited data. Using a management strategy evaluation framework we quantified the performance of a number of data-limited methods. For most life-histories, we found that methods that made use of only historical catches often performed worse than maintaining current fishing levels. Only those methods that dynamically accounted for changes in abundance and/or depletion performed well at low stock sizes. Stock assessments that make use of historical catch and effort data did not necessarily out-perform simpler data-limited methods that made use of fewer data. There is a high value of additional information regarding stock depletion, historical fishing effort and current abundance when only catch data are available. We discuss the implications of our results for other data-limited methods and identify future research priorities.},

Implementing a science-based system for preventing overfishing and guiding sustainable fisheries in the United States. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 71: 183–194. Fisheries management in the United States is primarily governed by the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, first enacted in 1976. Overarching principles are that fishing mortality rates should not jeopardize the capacity of a stock to produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and that overfished stocks (i.e. biomass is too low) should be rebuilt to the level that will support MSY. The science-based system for achieving sustainable fisheries is implemented, in part, through setting annual catch limits (ACLs) that cannot exceed the acceptable biological catch that is recommended by Scientific and Statistical Committees using methods that account for scientific uncertainty. Accountability measures (AMs) are management measures to prevent ACLs from being exceeded or correct any overages that occur. Implementation in 2012 of ACLs and AMs in all Federal fisheries was a historical achievement in the United States; one that will help rebuild stocks and ensure sustainable fisheries into the future. Some remaining challenges include: determining appropriate catch levels and management approaches for stocks with incomplete data; assessing more stocks, more frequently; addressing differences between managing stocks as a complex vs. managing individual stocks in a multistock fishery; and incorporating social and economic factors in determining the appropriate response to uncertainty.},
