	abstract = {Fishery managers are faced with the challenge of maintaining sustainable fisheries at the lowest possible cost while conforming to international and national obligations. Given that fisheries range from low to high value, there is a real need to understand how to trade ecological and economic risks, and the various costs associated with their management, against the benefits from catch. Key to this is an understanding of (a) the costs corresponding to a given level of acceptable risk, or conversely, (b) the change in risk given a change in cost investment. This paper first defines biological, economic and ecosystem risk at a whole-of-fishery level, and then develops a simple model to quantify the trade-offs between risk, cost and catch. Using as case studies Australia's federally managed fisheries that range from data-rich to data-poor, risk was quantified for target species in terms of both their limit and target reference points (defined as “biological risk” and “economic risk”, respectively), and for ecosystems in terms of overall ecological impact (defined as “ecosystem risk”). A statistical linear model was used to quantify the risk–cost–catch frontier for each of the three forms of risk. The most parsimonious models were statistically significant for each. However, the management and research costs were mostly positively correlated with risk, indicating that these tended to be reactive to risk, as opposed to risk decreasing in response to increased costs. The only model where this was not the case was for the ecosystem risk, which is probably because these risks have only recently been assessed and the management response to these risks across all the fisheries has so far been limited. For target species risks, it was not possible to develop a model for proactive use. However, the method itself has merit and, if the costs were defined to a greater level of resolution, and/or a time-dynamic modelling approach considered, these issues could potentially be addressed.},

	abstract = {The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) established a target in 2002 to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010. Using a newly constructed global database for 207 populations (108 species), we examine whether the 2010 target has been met for marine fishes, while accounting for population biomass relative to maximum sustainable yield, BMSY. Although rate of decline has eased for 59\% of populations declining before 1992 (a pattern consistent with a literal interpretation of the target), the percentage of populations below BMSY has remained unchanged and the rate of decline has increased among several top predators, many of which are below 0.5BMSY. Combining population trends, a global multispecies index indicates that marine fishes declined 38\% between 1970 and 2007. The index has been below BMSY since the mid-1980s and stable since the early 1990s. With the exception of High Seas pelagic fishes and demersal species in the Northeast Pacific and Australia – New Zealand, the multispecies indices are..., La Convention sur la diversité biologique (« CBD ») s’est donnée en 2002 comme objectif de réduire le taux de perte de la biodiversité avant 2010. Utilisant une nouvelle base de données globale de 207 populations (108 espèces), nous examinons si l’objectif 2010 de la CBD a été atteint pour les poissons marins, tout en tenant compte de la biomasse des populations relative au rendement maximal durable, BMSY. Malgré une diminution du taux de déclin chez 59 \% des populations en chute avant 1992 (une tendance qui correspond à une interprétation littérale de l’objectif 2010 de la CBD), le pourcentage des populations sous BMSY s’est maintenu constant et le taux de déclin s’est accéléré chez plusieurs des prédateurs sommitaux, une majorité desquels sont à un niveau inférieur à 0,5BMSY. Combinant les tendances des populations, un indice global multi-espèces montre que les poissons marins ont diminué de 38 \% entre 1970 et 2007. L’indice est inférieur à BMSY depuis le milieu des années 1980 et stable depuis le début...},
